Hello, in this sheet we will explain how the project works, and what features we expect.
First of all, during an nft mint, a random number will be assigned to the created nft.

This NFT will have a dna such as "150905070111" ("15.09.05.07.01.11") each number (15, 09, ...) is between 00 and 15 because there are 16 traits per body part + 16 backgrounds. 16 is the least rare and 00 the rarest. However, combinations of equal numbers are also rare (01.01.01.01.01.01, 12.12.12.12.12.12, ...) and the attributes must be created so that these combinations are well complementary, for example if the eyes 05 are dragon eyes then the mouth 05 will also be a dragon mouth, etc ... .
It will also be necessary that any combination of numbers works.

In each of the folders of this file you will see illustrations found resembling what is expected, with their number on it to help you. You will also find a file to describe more precisely each given image, or to describe if no image has been found.

Do not hesitate for any question and thank you very much for your investment in our project.
