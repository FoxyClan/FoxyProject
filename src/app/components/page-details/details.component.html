            <p class="justified">
              Welcome to the FoxyClan NFT universe, where creativity and rarity come together for a unique experience.
              Each Foxy NFT is randomly generated with over <span class="strong">80 different traits</span>,
              more or less <span class="strong">rare</span>. Only 20,000 Foxy NFTs will ever exist, making each one unique and valuable.
              This system also enables innovative features like <span class="strong">NFT merge</span>, unlocking even more possibilities for 
              evolution and exclusivity.

            <h1>Traits</h1>
            <p class="justified">Each image associated with an NFT consists of several traits that determine its appearance and rarity. Here are the different types of traits you'll find in our collection:</p>
            <p>
              16 Head Covering<br>
              16 Eyes<br>

            <div class="block1-right">
              <h1>DNA & Rarity</h1>
              <p class="justified">Each NFT has unique DNA that represents traits. For example, DNA 
                <span class="strong">071402070810</span> indicates the following trait numbers:</p>
              <p>
                Head Covering : 07<br>
                Eyes : 14<br>
                Mouth : 02<br>
                Clothes : 07<br>
                Fur : 08<br>
                Background : 10
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p class="justified padding">
            The rarity scale for each trait ranges from <span class="strong">00 (rarest)</span> to <span class="strong">15 (least rare)</span>. This means that the rarest combinations are also the most valuable.<br>
            Each DNA is unique and can only be specific to one NFT. In the same way, no NFT can have the same DNA with simply a change of background or transcendence, so characters without their background are also unique.

            <p class="justified">
              Each NFT Foxy has a <span class="strong">Level</span> and <span class="strong">FoxyPoints</span>. A Foxy gains a level when merged with another (Foxy the maximum level is 3).<br>
              FoxyPoints can be earned during a merge (<span class="strong">+100 FP</span> for a first merger and <span class="strong">+250 FP</span> for the second), but also during future missions or games. 
              A Foxy can automatically earn points every day based on their level. 
              <i>No one yet knows what these mysterious FP are for, but an old legend says that they are very valuable and allow you to obtain large rewards later on...</i>

            <p class="justified">
              One of the most exciting features of our collection is the ability to merge two NFTs you own.<br>
              This process allows you to create an advanced NFT with:<br>
            </p>
              <ul>
                <li><span>&#x27A4;</span> Level +1</li>
                <li><span>&#x27A4;</span> The FoxyPoints of both Foxies + FP merge bonus</li>
                <li><span>&#x27A4;</span> The best traits of each Foxy + the possibility of having enhanced traits</li>
                <li><span>&#x27A4;</span> Possibility of having a Transcendence trait</li>
                <li><span>&#x27A4;</span> Increased FP earned daily.</li>
              </ul>
              
            <p>Merge rules :</p>
            <p class="justified">
              - Two Foxies can only be merged if one of them is level 1.<br>
              - A level 3 Foxy can no longer be merged.<br>
              - If the merged DNA already exists, then the DNA is enhanced to remain unique. <br>
              - If the DNA cannot be enhanced, then the two NFTs cannot be merged.<br>
              - An undiscovered Foxy cannot be merged.<br>
              - When two Foxies are merged, both NFTs are burned and a third one with a new token ID is created.<br>
              - Burned NFTs are not rebuilt, so the total supply will permanently decrease.<br>
